# Neovim config files

I tried to make it as modular as possible so it's easy to understand and mantain.

## Install

This config is able to bootstrap itself. The first time you open Neovim everything
will be installed automatically.

```shell
cd ~/.config
git clone https://github.com/eligum/nvim.git
```

Plugins will be installed at `~/.local/share/nvim/`.
